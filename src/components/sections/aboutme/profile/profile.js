        <Description>
          I recently moved to Stockholm, Sweden and I am taking my
          first steps in the world of web development, with knowledge in Javascript, React, HTML,
          CSS, Node.js and Git.
          <br />
          <br /> I consider myself a proactive and eager to learn person. Always
          trying to learn, improve and look for new challenges.
          <br />
          <br /> My goal is to combine my passion for coding and design to
          become a skilled frontend developer, creating clean and efficient code
          that gives users the best experience.
          <br />
          <br />I am currently working as Software Developer, focusing on
          improving my coding skills, problem solving and decision making in
          order to prioritize the development of the product and the clientâ€™s
          needs.
